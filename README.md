# CreditCard_Default_prediction

## In this notebook we are going to predict whether a person is going to default on his/her next month payment based on his/her payment history.

    We used here Gaussian Naive Bayes and XGBOOST for this purpose.

    Initially we got 59% accuracy with GNB, after hyperparameter tuning it increased to 77% that's not bad.
    After that I tried with XGB algo, and got accuracy of 72% without tuning it. After hypermeter tuning the 
    accuracy I got was 82%
    
 #### I have achieved a good accuracy but still there is scope to increase the accuracy by processing the data and trying with different algorithms/strategies.
